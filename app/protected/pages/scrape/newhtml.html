<h2>What are barcodes?</h2>
<p>From an original idea patented in the USA in 1952 by [Woodland and Silver], barcode
really became commercialised in the late 1960s in the USA, driven by two key industries,
the Grocery/Food/Supermarket sector and the US railways. Work in the grocery sector
eventually resulted in the UPC code which was first used in 1974. (A packet of Wrigleys
chewing gum was the very first item to be read ).Since the first use in 1974, the UPC
code became extended to include 2 extra digits to become EAN, which is now probably the
most widely used code in the world. Barcode really started to be taken up by industry in
1981 when the US Department of Defence adopted Code 39 for the coding of military
equipment.</p>
<p>As time went on, further coding systems were developed and today there are a wide range
of different symbologies, available to users.</p>
<p>Barcode is the most widely used identification technology in the world and nowadays there
can't be many people on the planet who don't know what a barcode is. It is a very
powerful technology, very cheap to produce with a wide range of scanning and printing
equipment available in the market at competitive prices. Blackroc provides a wide range
of barcode scanning equipment which you can find in the products section of this
website.</p>
<p>There are those who consider that barcode has had it's day and that RFID tags will soon
replace it. This is a very limited view. It is unlikely that barcode will be replaced by
RFID certainly for identification at item level, and in the future it is likely that the
two technologies will be used side by side, utilising the different strengths of each to
suit particular requirements within the same application.</p>

<h2><a name="barcode1" id="barcode1">How does it work?</a></h2>
<p>A traditional (linear) barcode label consists of a series of black and white bars of
different widths arranged according to a specific set of rules for that particular
barcode type or "symbology". A light source from a barcode reader or "scanner" (CCD or
laser), illuminates the label, and receiving optics in the scanner head record the
returned light signal from the white spaces which reflect the light and the black bars
which absorb the light. These reflected peaks and troughs are converted into electronic
signals which are then decoded according to the rules for that particular symbology, into
ASCII characters.</p>
<p>Many different linear symbologies are available nowadays, including the
following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>UPC-Based Symbologies:<ul>
<li>UPC-A: Used with consumer products in U.S., 12 characters</li>
<li>UPC-E: Short version of UPC symbol, 6 characters</li>
<li>EAN-13: Used with consumer products internationally, 13 characters</li>
<li>EAN-8: Short version of EAN-13, 8 characters</li>
<li>JAN Codes: Same as EAN-13, used in Japan</li>
<li>Bookland: Used to mark books with ISBN number</li>
        </ul></li>
<li>UPC-Based Extensions<ul>
<li>2-Digit Ext.: Used to indicate magazines and newspaper issue numbers</li>
<li>5-Digit Ext.: Used to mark suggested retail price of books</li>
    </ul></li>
<li>2 of 5 Symbologies:<ul>
<li>Standard 2 of 5: Used in airline ticket marking, photofinishing</li>
<li>Industrial 2 of 5: Same as Standard 2 of 5</li>
<li>Interleaved 2 of 5: Used in warehouse, industrial applications</li>
    </ul></li>
<li>Pulse Width Modulated Symbologies:<ul>
<li>Plessey Code: Old symbology, used for shelf marking in retail enviornments</li>
<li>MSI: Variation of Plessey code, with similar applications</li>
<li>Modified Plessey Code: Same as MSI</li>
<li>Anker Code: Used in European POS systems before EAN was implementated</li>
    </ul></li>
<li>Code 11 (USD-8): Used to identify telecommunications equipment<ul>
<li>Postnet: Printed by U.S. Post Office on envelopes</li>
<li>Codabar (aka Ames Code/USD-4/NW-7/2 of 7 Code): Used in libraries and blood
banks</li>
        </ul></li></ul>
<h2><a name="barcode2" id="barcode2">Alphanumeric Symbologies</a></h2>
<ul><li>Code 128 Based Symbologies:<ul>

<li>Code 128: Very dense code, used extensively worldwide</li>
<li>UCC/EAN-128: Used to encode shipping/product information</li>
<li>SISAC: Used to encode serial items/periodic magazines</li></ul></li>
<li>Code 39 (aka USD-3, 3 of 9): U.S. Government and military use, required for DoD
applications</li>
<li>Code 93 (aka USS-93): Compressed form of Code 39</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the late 1980s, the drive to encode ever more information in
combination with the space requirements of simple barcodes has led to the development of
another form of barcode which has been gaining greater popularity, that is the 2D
barcode. Linear barcodes can only ever contain a single string of data which acts as a
licence plate ID, i.e. the information about the item to which the barcode label is
attached has to be stored in a separate database to which the barcode number acts as a
pointer. In order to store more information on the label itself, (item attendant data),
the 2D barcode was developed. These barcode labels store data in both the x and y
direction, to give the possibility of storing up to 2Mb of data on the label itself.
Several different formats of 2D code have been developed.</p>

<h2><a name="barcode4" id="barcode4">What do I need to read a barcode
label?</a></h2>
There are a wide variety of bar code reading devices available including the
following:<br />
<br />
<h3><a name="barcode4_1" id="barcode4_1">Barcode Wand</a></h3>
<p>For many years this used to be the most popular device for reading barcodes mainly because of
cost. Wands or light-pens work by moving the wand's illuminated head across the barcode.
As the wand passes across the label, it records the peaks and troughs of reflected light
and the time duration of each from which it calculates the width of the bars. However
some skill is needed to use one, since it is important that the wand moves at a uniform
speed, so not everyone is good at it, and also the lens of the reader tends to wear as a
result of constant wiping across barcode labels. As the price of better scanning
technology has dropped, wands have lost ground to handheld scanners.</p>
<h3><a name="barcode4_2" id="barcode4_2">Handheld Scanners</a></h3>
<p>These devices are available in two principal technology formats, laser scanners and
imagers.</p>
<p>Laser scanners work by moving a tiny beam of laser light (using an oscillating mirror) in
a straight line across a barcode and reading the returned light signals. Considered
generally as the premier scanning technology, laser light can be emitted to a
considerable distance, and so it is the technology of choice for long range applications,
and scanners are available which can read up to 10 metres or so. Because the beam of
laser light is linear, for use with 2D barcodes a laser scanning beam has to be
"rastered", that is, moved up and down the label in order to get 2D coverage.</p>
<p>Imagers work by illuminating the barcode label using an array of LEDs in the head of the
scanner, and then taking an image of the code and then decoding the light and dark
spaces. Imagers take an image of the whole area ( e.g. for 2D barcodes), a bit like using
a camera. Because an imager works like a camera it can also be used for capturing
non-barcode images such as signatures and people's faces for example.</p>

<h2><a name="print1" id="print1">What do I need to print barcodes?</a></h2>
Dot matrix, laser, and ink jet printers can be used to print barcode labels, but they all
have their drawbacks. Thermal label printers are specifically designed for the task and
so give the best results. They can print at high speeds and can be used to print single
labels at a time, or whole rolls at once.<br />
<br />
<h3><a name="print2" id="print2">Thermal Printing Explained.</a></h3>
<p>Thermal printing involves heat transfer from a thermal printhead to a heat sensitive
paper or ribbon. The printhead consists of a long, linear array of tiny resistive heating
elements that are arranged perpendicular to the flow of the paper. Each element heats the
area directly below it on the paper and the image is produced by the rows of dots that
are printed onto the paper as it passes beneath the printhead.</p>
<br />
There are two basic thermal printing methods:<br />
<br />
<h4><a name="print2_1" id="print2_1">Direct Thermal Printing
(DT)</a></h4>
<p>With this method, the printhead is in direct contact with the
chemically treated paper and no ribbon is used. As a result, the running costs are lower,
however, this method will also wear down the printhead faster than with thermal transfer
as paper is coarse and will wear the printhead down over time. In addition to this the
edge of each label strikes the printhead as it passes causing further wear. So although
no ribbon is needed, the printhead will wear out faster. Printheads are considered to be
consumables and must be included in the overall cost of operation.</p>
<p>This method should be used where the lifecycle of the label is very short, and cannot
come into contact with heat or ultra violet light. Thermal paper will mark if scratched
and will eventually turn black if left for long periods of time.</p>

<h4><a name="print2_2" id="print2_2">Thermal Transfer Printing
(TT)</a></h4>
<p>Thermal Transfer printer use the same technology as direct thermal
printer. Heat from the printhead is applied to the ribbon, the material on the ribbon is
then transferred to the label media. The thermal transfer method will cost more due to
the need for a ribbon, but there will also be less wear on the printhead, prolonging its
life.</p>
<p>This method should be used where there is a greater label lifecycle required. There is a
much higher variety of media stock, which is higher in durability. Also the quality of
print is generally higher.</p>
